# Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment

**Primetrade.ai Data Science Intern Assignment**

## 📌 Project Objective

This project analyzes how **market sentiment (Fear vs Greed)** influences trader behavior and performance on the Hyperliquid exchange.

The goal is to uncover behavioral trading patterns and derive actionable strategy insights using:

* Data Analysis
* Behavioral Segmentation
* Machine Learning
* Interactive Dashboard

---

## 📂 Dataset

Two datasets were used:

1. **Bitcoin Market Sentiment (Fear & Greed Index)**

   * Daily sentiment classification

2. **Historical Trader Data (Hyperliquid)**

   * Trade executions
   * Position sizes
   * PnL
   * Trade direction

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### Data Preparation

* Cleaned missing & duplicate values
* Converted timestamps to daily level
* Merged trading data with sentiment data

### Feature Engineering

Created behavioral trading metrics:

* Daily PnL
* Win rate
* Trade frequency
* Long/Short ratio
* Position size (proxy for leverage)
* Drawdown proxy (loss magnitude)

### Analysis

Compared trader performance across sentiment regimes:

* Fear vs Greed profitability
* Behavioral shifts
* Risk appetite changes

### Segmentation

Traders grouped into behavioral archetypes:

* High vs Low leverage traders
* Frequent vs Infrequent traders
* Consistent vs Inconsistent traders

### Machine Learning

Predicted trade profitability using:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest (best performance)

### Dashboard

Built an interactive Streamlit app to:

* Explore trader behavior
* Visualize sentiment impact
* Simulate profitability prediction

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Trader behavior significantly changes across sentiment regimes
* Risk-taking increases during Greed markets
* Large losses occur more frequently during Fear periods
* Consistent traders reduce activity in volatile sentiment phases
